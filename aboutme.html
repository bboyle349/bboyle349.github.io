    <p1 class="aaa"><center> Hello! My name is Ben Boyle, and I am currently a sophmore at the University of Rhode Island. This is my second year attending URI, and despite it being quite different this year, so far I've enjoyed what I can out of it.
      <br> I'm looking to star my degree in Computer Science this semester by starting off with this course. I am from East Greenwich, Rhode Island, and I graduated from East Greenwich High School in spring 2018. In my free time, 
      <br>I enjoy playing guitar and playing small gigs with my friends, which has unfortunatly slowed down due to the pandemic. I am also currently working at Salk's Ace Hardware & Marine while I'm not in class, where I 
      <br> have been employed for just over two and a half years.</center></p1>
