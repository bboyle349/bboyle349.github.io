            <p1><center> The program opens with a splash screen that I have designed, which provides a bitmoji character that I have created earlier in the year, as well as the instructions to use the program.
            <br> To use this program, the user would begin by moving their mouse over the START button, and clicking their mouse to progress to the first question. Upon reaching the second page, the user is greeted
            <br> with a simple math equation, 2 x 2. Being that the answer is 4, the user would click the correct answer, and upon clicking the correct answer, will be greeted with a bright green sign that indicates
            <br> to the user that they had answered correctly. However, if an incorrect answer is clicked, nothing will be displayed as a result. Once the user has answered correctly and wants to continue to the next
            <br> question, all the user has to do is click the NEXT button, which is displayed below the question. Being that there are a total of 5 questions, the user will repeat this process a total of five times,
            <br>  at which point after the final question, the page will need to be refreshed to play through the program again. </center></p1>
