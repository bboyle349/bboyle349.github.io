    <h1><center><strong>Welcome to Ben's Programming Portfolio</strong></center></h1>
    
    <p1><center><br>This site was created entirely using HTML coding methods. This site also serves as the unofficial layout for what will ultimatley become my portfolio site by the end of the semester.
    <br> If you click the links above, they will link you to various pages on the site. The Javascripts link will take you to all of my work from the semester. For right now, the page is empty
    <br> as there is currently nothing to put there. To the right of that, I have my about me page, which gives a brief background about myself and my life, as well as some photos of my life. </center></p1>
